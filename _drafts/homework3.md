### Resources for this assignment

#### Normal inverse-Wishart

#### Implementing and debugging MCMC algorithms

- link up with previous assignment!
- getting it right
- exact result and other theoretical properties

#### Useful libraries

### Question 1: A parametric model

NOTE: don't forget to use your tutorial making tool!!

- posterior updates
- predictive

### Question 2: Gibbs sampler

- naive one
- reducing the running time from K^2 to K
- deriving Bayes estimator for the density estimation

### Optional questions

- Peskun speedup
- Distributed stick breaking implementation
- Global stick moves (change the order of the cluster indicators) [nb: can be done using SMC]
- Matrix: profiling, Cholesky, in place, JBLA
- other likelihoods
